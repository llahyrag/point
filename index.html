				    <h1>Identifying and Resolving Bottlenecks in Road Construction Projects</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Road construction represents one of the most visible and impactful sectors of infrastructure development. From minor local repairs to major highway expansions, these projects significantly influence economic development, community connectivity, and overall quality of life. Despite their importance, road construction projects are notoriously prone to delays, cost overruns, and quality issues. At the heart of these challenges lie various bottlenecks—constraints or obstacles that limit the efficiency and effectiveness of the construction process.</p>
<p>The impact of these bottlenecks extends far beyond mere inconvenience. Delays in road construction directly translate to increased congestion, extended commute times, higher vehicle operating costs, and elevated accident risks in temporary traffic configurations. Moreover, the economic consequences are substantial, with businesses suffering from reduced accessibility and governments facing escalating project costs. In the UK alone, construction delays cost the economy billions of pounds annually, with road projects representing a significant portion of these losses.</p>
<p>This article examines the primary bottlenecks in road construction projects, exploring their causes, impacts, and potential solutions. By identifying these critical constraints and implementing targeted strategies to address them, stakeholders can significantly improve project outcomes, reduce disruptions, and deliver higher-quality infrastructure more efficiently and cost-effectively.</p>
<h2 id="planning-and-approval-bottlenecks">Planning and Approval Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="complex-regulatory-frameworks">Complex Regulatory Frameworks</h3>
<p>Road construction projects in the UK operate within a complex web of regulations and standards. The Highways England Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB) alone contains over 300 documents detailing specifications for trunk roads and motorways. Local authorities maintain additional requirements for regional and municipal roads. This regulatory complexity creates a substantial administrative burden, as project managers must navigate multiple, sometimes conflicting, requirements from different authorities.</p>
<p>The consequences of this regulatory maze manifest in several ways. First, it significantly extends the planning phase, with studies showing that major road projects spend an average of 7-10 years in planning and approval processes before construction begins. Second, it increases project costs, with compliance-related activities accounting for approximately 8-12% of total project budgets. Finally, it increases the risk of delays due to regulatory non-compliance, which can halt construction and require costly redesigns.</p>
<h3 id="public-consultation-challenges">Public Consultation Challenges</h3>
<p>Public consultation represents another significant planning bottleneck. While public engagement is essential for democratic infrastructure development, the current processes often prove inefficient and contentious. Public inquiries for major road schemes can extend for years, particularly when projects face substantial local opposition.</p>
<p>The M4 relief road in South Wales exemplifies this bottleneck. The project underwent multiple public consultations spanning more than a decade before ultimately being cancelled in 2019, wasting millions in planning costs. Similar scenarios have played out across the UK, with projects like the A303 Stonehenge tunnel and various bypass schemes becoming ensnared in prolonged consultation processes.</p>
<p>These delays stem from several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inadequate early engagement with communities</li>
<li>Inflexible consultation formats that fail to genuinely incorporate public input</li>
<li>Political hesitation in making decisions that may prove locally unpopular</li>
<li>Lack of clear decision-making frameworks for balancing competing interests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="funding-uncertainties">Funding Uncertainties</h3>
<p>Funding uncertainties represent a third major planning bottleneck. Road projects in the UK rely on various funding mechanisms, including central government allocations, local authority budgets, and increasingly, private finance initiatives. However, these funding streams are often unstable and unpredictable.</p>
<p>The stop-start nature of funding creates numerous inefficiencies. Projects may progress through initial planning stages only to be shelved when funding priorities shift. When funding later becomes available, plans may require updating to reflect changed conditions or regulations, creating additional delays and costs. This uncertainty also affects contractor pricing, as companies factor risk premiums into their bids to account for potential funding disruptions.</p>
<h2 id="material-and-resource-bottlenecks">Material and Resource Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="supply-chain-vulnerabilities">Supply Chain Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>The road construction industry relies on complex supply chains for critical materials such as aggregates, asphalt, concrete, and steel. These supply chains have proven increasingly vulnerable to disruptions, creating significant bottlenecks in project delivery.</p>
<p>Recent years have exposed the fragility of these networks. Brexit-related border complications increased lead times for imported materials and components by 15-40%. The COVID-19 pandemic further strained supply chains, with 82% of UK construction projects reporting material delays during 2020-2021. More recently, global conflicts have disrupted energy markets, affecting the production of energy-intensive materials like cement and asphalt.</p>
<p>These disruptions manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Material shortages leading to work stoppages</li>
<li>Price volatility undermining budget forecasts</li>
<li>Quality inconsistencies requiring additional testing and potential rework</li>
<li>Substitution of materials requiring design modifications and regulatory reapproval</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labour-shortages">Labour Shortages</h3>
<p>The road construction sector faces chronic skilled labour shortages, creating another significant bottleneck. The UK construction industry currently has approximately 250,000 unfilled positions, with road-specific trades like highway engineering, heavy equipment operation, and specialist surfacing among the most affected.</p>
<p>Several factors drive this bottleneck:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ageing workforce, with approximately 20-25% of road construction workers approaching retirement age</li>
<li>Declining interest in construction careers among younger generations</li>
<li>Competition from other sectors offering better working conditions or higher wages</li>
<li>Post-Brexit restrictions on skilled worker mobility from EU countries</li>
<li>Insufficient investment in training and apprenticeship programmes</li>
</ul>
<p>These shortages directly impact project timelines. A 2023 survey by the Civil Engineering Contractors Association found that 68% of road projects experienced delays specifically attributed to labour shortages. More concerning, the quality of workmanship has declined in some instances as less experienced workers take on responsibilities beyond their training level.</p>
<h3 id="equipment-limitations">Equipment Limitations</h3>
<p>Specialised equipment represents a third resource bottleneck. Road construction relies on highly specialised machinery—pavers, milling machines, rollers, and material transfer vehicles—that often have limited availability and high demand.</p>
<p>Equipment bottlenecks manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheduling conflicts when multiple projects require the same specialised equipment</li>
<li>Maintenance and breakdown issues causing work stoppages</li>
<li>Technological limitations of available equipment compared to project requirements</li>
<li>High mobilisation costs making short work windows economically inefficient</li>
</ul>
<p>The impact of equipment constraints becomes particularly pronounced during seasonal peak construction periods when multiple projects compete for limited resources. This bottleneck often forces projects into suboptimal scheduling, with work occurring during less favourable weather conditions or creating unnecessary traffic disruptions during peak travel periods.</p>
<h2 id="construction-phase-bottlenecks">Construction Phase Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="traffic-management-constraints">Traffic Management Constraints</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most visible bottleneck in road construction involves traffic management during active construction. Unlike building construction, road projects typically occur within or adjacent to active transportation corridors, creating unique constraints.</p>
<p>Traffic management requirements significantly impact construction efficiency in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced working space limiting equipment manoeuvrability and material staging</li>
<li>Time restrictions limiting work to nights or weekends when traffic volumes are lower</li>
<li>Segmentation of work into smaller phases to maintain traffic flow</li>
<li>Safety buffer requirements reducing effective working areas</li>
<li>Lower productivity due to worker distraction and safety concerns from passing traffic</li>
</ul>
<p>These constraints substantially reduce efficiency. Studies indicate that road construction conducted under active traffic conditions experiences 30-45% lower productivity compared to equivalent work in unrestricted environments. This productivity loss directly translates to extended project durations and increased costs.</p>
<h3 id="weather-vulnerabilities">Weather Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>Weather represents another significant construction-phase bottleneck. Road construction involves numerous weather-sensitive activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earthworks requiring specific soil moisture conditions</li>
<li>Asphalt paving requiring minimum temperature thresholds</li>
<li>Concrete curing requiring controlled temperature and humidity</li>
<li>Line marking requiring dry surfaces</li>
<li>Structural work susceptible to wind limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>The UK&#39;s climate, characterised by frequent precipitation and moderate temperatures, creates substantial weather-related constraints. Major road projects typically lose 40-60 working days annually to adverse weather conditions. Climate change appears to be exacerbating this bottleneck, with more extreme weather events increasing both the frequency and duration of weather-related work stoppages.</p>
<h3 id="utility-conflicts">Utility Conflicts</h3>
<p>Underground and overhead utilities represent a third major construction-phase bottleneck. Road corridors typically contain complex utility networks—water, sewer, electricity, gas, telecommunications—that must be protected, relocated, or accommodated during construction.</p>
<p>Utility conflicts create bottlenecks through several mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unexpected utility discoveries requiring design modifications</li>
<li>Coordination delays with multiple utility companies</li>
<li>Service interruption restrictions limiting work windows</li>
<li>Physical workspace conflicts between construction and utility protection requirements</li>
<li>Damage to utilities causing both construction delays and service disruptions</li>
</ul>
<p>A 2022 study by Transport Research Laboratory found that utility-related issues accounted for approximately 25% of all construction phase delays on UK road projects. The same study noted that initial project schedules systematically underestimated the time required for utility coordination, creating planning fallacies that propagated throughout project timelines.</p>
<h2 id="technical-and-design-bottlenecks">Technical and Design Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="ground-condition-uncertainties">Ground Condition Uncertainties</h3>
<p>Ground conditions represent one of the most significant technical bottlenecks in road construction. Despite geotechnical investigations, subsurface conditions often differ from expectations, requiring design modifications and construction adaptations.</p>
<p>Several factors contribute to this bottleneck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherent limitations in site investigation coverage, with boreholes and test pits sampling only a tiny fraction of the construction area</li>
<li>Heterogeneous ground conditions that vary significantly between sampling points</li>
<li>Historical land uses introducing unexpected contamination or buried structures</li>
<li>Groundwater variations affecting soil stability and construction methods</li>
<li>Variable rock conditions requiring different excavation techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>These uncertainties manifest in construction delays, cost overruns, and occasional quality issues. Major road projects in the UK typically allocate 10-15% contingency specifically for ground-related risks, yet still frequently exceed these allocations. The A465 Heads of the Valleys road improvement scheme in Wales experienced a two-year delay and £100 million cost increase largely due to unexpected ground conditions within mountainous terrain.</p>
<h3 id="design-coordination-challenges">Design Coordination Challenges</h3>
<p>Modern road projects involve multiple design disciplines—civil, structural, geotechnical, drainage, lighting, signalling, and environmental mitigation—that must be coordinated into a cohesive whole. This coordination represents a substantial technical bottleneck.</p>
<p>Coordination challenges manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clash detection failures leading to field conflicts</li>
<li>Inconsistent design assumptions between disciplines</li>
<li>Information transfer delays between design teams</li>
<li>Late design changes propagating through multiple systems</li>
<li>Incomplete integration of specialist subcontractor designs</li>
</ul>
<p>While Building Information Modelling (BIM) has improved coordination in vertical construction, its application in horizontal infrastructure like roads remains less mature. A 2023 survey found that only 38% of UK road projects fully implemented BIM Level 2 standards, despite government mandates. This technological gap contributes to persistent coordination bottlenecks.</p>
<h3 id="specification-inadequacies">Specification Inadequacies</h3>
<p>Technical specifications represent a third major design bottleneck. Inadequate, ambiguous, or overly restrictive specifications lead to construction delays through requests for information, disputes over requirements, and occasional rework.</p>
<p>Common specification issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>References to outdated standards or unavailable materials</li>
<li>Conflicting requirements between different specification sections</li>
<li>Overly prescriptive methods that prevent innovation or adaptation to field conditions</li>
<li>Insufficient performance criteria for proprietary systems</li>
<li>Ambiguous quality control and acceptance criteria</li>
</ul>
<p>These specification issues create bottlenecks through extended approval processes, conservative interpretations to manage risk, and occasional work stoppages while clarifications are obtained. The cumulative impact significantly affects project timelines, particularly when issues cascade through sequential activities.</p>
<h2 id="administrative-and-contractual-bottlenecks">Administrative and Contractual Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="procurement-inefficiencies">Procurement Inefficiencies</h3>
<p>The procurement process represents a significant administrative bottleneck in road construction. Current procurement methods often prioritise lowest bid price over value, creating perverse incentives that undermine project efficiency.</p>
<p>Several aspects of procurement create bottlenecks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extended tender periods with multiple clarification rounds</li>
<li>Inadequate pre-qualification processes allowing unsuitable contractors to bid</li>
<li>Excessive focus on initial price rather than whole-life value</li>
<li>Risk allocation approaches that encourage adversarial relationships</li>
<li>Limited consideration of past performance in award decisions</li>
</ul>
<p>These procurement inefficiencies manifest in project delays, quality issues, and adversarial relationships that impede problem-solving. Research indicates that projects using collaborative procurement models like Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) deliver 15-20% faster than traditional procurement approaches, highlighting the impact of this bottleneck.</p>
<h3 id="contract-administration-burdens">Contract Administration Burdens</h3>
<p>Once contracts are awarded, administrative requirements create additional bottlenecks. Modern road construction contracts involve extensive documentation, approval processes, and compliance requirements that consume significant time and resources.</p>
<p>Administrative burdens include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple layers of approval for changes and payments</li>
<li>Extensive reporting requirements across various stakeholders</li>
<li>Complex change order processes that delay implementation of necessary modifications</li>
<li>Rigid contractual mechanisms ill-suited to field realities</li>
<li>Defensive documentation practices stemming from low-trust environments</li>
</ul>
<p>These administrative burdens divert resources from productive work to paperwork. Project managers report spending 30-40% of their time on contract administration rather than technical problem-solving or forward planning. This administrative overhead represents a substantial hidden bottleneck in project delivery.</p>
<h3 id="dispute-resolution-delays">Dispute Resolution Delays</h3>
<p>Contractual disputes represent a third major administrative bottleneck. Despite various dispute resolution mechanisms, conflicts over changes, delays, and payment issues frequently disrupt project progress.</p>
<p>Dispute-related bottlenecks manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work slowdowns or stoppages during payment disputes</li>
<li>Resource diversion to claims preparation and defence</li>
<li>Deteriorating relationships affecting collaboration on technical issues</li>
<li>Decision paralysis as participants avoid potential liability</li>
<li>Management attention focused on past issues rather than upcoming work</li>
</ul>
<p>While various alternative dispute resolution methods exist—adjudication, mediation, dispute review boards—their implementation often proves inconsistent and sometimes creates additional delays. The construction industry&#39;s adversarial culture continues to amplify this bottleneck despite decades of reform attempts.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-and-sustainability-bottlenecks">Environmental and Sustainability Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="environmental-assessment-complexities">Environmental Assessment Complexities</h3>
<p>Environmental assessments represent a crucial but often bottleneck-prone aspect of road construction. These assessments involve complex studies of potential impacts on air quality, water resources, biodiversity, cultural heritage, and community well-being.</p>
<p>Several factors contribute to this bottleneck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seasonal restrictions on environmental surveys extending baseline data collection</li>
<li>Evolving regulatory requirements creating moving compliance targets</li>
<li>Cumulative impact considerations requiring broad-scale assessments</li>
<li>Public challenges to environmental conclusions extending review processes</li>
<li>Late discovery of protected species or habitats requiring design modifications</li>
</ul>
<p>The A303 Stonehenge tunnel project exemplifies this bottleneck. Environmental concerns, particularly regarding archaeological impacts, have delayed the project for over a decade through multiple assessment iterations and legal challenges. Similar scenarios play out across numerous road projects, with environmental assessments frequently becoming critical path activities that determine overall project timelines.</p>
<h3 id="carbon-reduction-challenges">Carbon Reduction Challenges</h3>
<p>As the UK pursues its net-zero carbon commitments, carbon reduction requirements create new bottlenecks in road construction. Traditional road construction methods involve carbon-intensive materials and processes that conflict with emissions reduction targets.</p>
<p>Carbon-related bottlenecks manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited availability of low-carbon materials at required volumes</li>
<li>Performance uncertainties with novel sustainable materials requiring extended testing</li>
<li>Incomplete carbon accounting methods creating inconsistent evaluation criteria</li>
<li>Complex trade-offs between immediate construction emissions and lifecycle impacts</li>
<li>Regulatory inconsistencies regarding carbon requirements across different authorities</li>
</ul>
<p>These challenges sometimes create implementation delays as projects struggle to reconcile conventional engineering approaches with emerging carbon constraints. However, this bottleneck also drives innovation, with projects like the A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon improvement scheme demonstrating that carbon reduction targets can be achieved through careful material selection and process optimisation.</p>
<h3 id="waste-management-constraints">Waste Management Constraints</h3>
<p>Waste management represents a third environmental bottleneck. Road construction generates substantial waste streams—excavated soil, demolished materials, packaging, and various construction residuals—that require proper handling and disposal.</p>
<p>Waste-related bottlenecks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limited capacity at licensed disposal facilities creating queueing delays</li>
<li>Complex classification requirements for potentially hazardous materials</li>
<li>Inconsistent acceptance criteria between disposal facilities</li>
<li>Administrative burdens associated with waste transfer documentation</li>
<li>Costly treatment requirements for marginally contaminated materials</li>
</ul>
<p>The circular economy approach—reusing and recycling materials within the project—offers potential solutions but introduces its own bottlenecks related to material testing, storage logistics, and quality assurance. Finding the optimal balance between waste minimisation and construction efficiency remains an ongoing challenge.</p>
<h2 id="digital-and-technological-bottlenecks">Digital and Technological Bottlenecks</h2>
<h3 id="data-integration-challenges">Data Integration Challenges</h3>
<p>Modern road construction involves numerous digital systems—design software, project management platforms, financial systems, quality control databases, and equipment telematics—that struggle to share information effectively. This fragmentation creates significant efficiency bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Data integration challenges manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manual re-entry of information between disconnected systems</li>
<li>Inconsistent data formats requiring transformation and validation</li>
<li>Delayed access to critical information stored in separate repositories</li>
<li>Inability to perform integrated analyses across multiple data sources</li>
<li>Versioning conflicts creating uncertainty about current information</li>
</ul>
<p>These integration challenges reduce productivity, with project teams spending 15-20% of their time managing information rather than using it for decision-making. The resulting information latency creates cascading delays as decisions rely on outdated or incomplete data.</p>
<h3 id="technology-adoption-barriers">Technology Adoption Barriers</h3>
<p>While numerous technological solutions could address various construction bottlenecks, their adoption faces significant barriers within the industry. These barriers represent meta-bottlenecks that prevent the resolution of other constraints.</p>
<p>Adoption barriers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>High initial investment costs with uncertain returns</li>
<li>Workforce resistance to changing established practices</li>
<li>Incompatibility between new technologies and existing systems</li>
<li>Insufficient training resources for effective implementation</li>
<li>Risk aversion regarding unproven solutions</li>
</ul>
<p>These barriers slow the diffusion of potentially transformative technologies like machine control systems, automated quality control, prefabrication, and advanced materials. The resulting technology gap contributes to the productivity stagnation that has characterised construction while other industries have achieved substantial efficiency improvements.</p>
<h3 id="cybersecurity-vulnerabilities">Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities</h3>
<p>As road construction becomes increasingly digitalised, cybersecurity vulnerabilities emerge as a new bottleneck. Connected equipment, remote monitoring systems, and digital collaboration platforms create attack surfaces that require protection.</p>
<p>Cybersecurity bottlenecks manifest in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access restrictions limiting information sharing across organisations</li>
<li>System isolation requirements preventing full integration</li>
<li>Update and patch management disrupting system availability</li>
<li>Recovery processes following security incidents</li>
<li>Compliance requirements creating administrative overhead</li>
</ul>
<p>While currently less significant than other bottlenecks, cybersecurity constraints will likely grow as digitalisation increases and threat actors recognise the potential impact of disrupting critical infrastructure construction.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward-integrated-solutions">Moving Forward: Integrated Solutions</h2>
<h3 id="collaborative-delivery-models">Collaborative Delivery Models</h3>
<p>Addressing road construction bottlenecks requires fundamental changes to project delivery models. Traditional siloed approaches perpetuate inefficiencies by disconnecting design from construction and fragmenting responsibility.</p>
<p>Collaborative models like alliance contracting and integrated project delivery offer promising alternatives. These approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Align incentives among all participants toward project success</li>
<li>Encourage early involvement of construction expertise in design</li>
<li>Facilitate shared problem-solving rather than risk transfer</li>
<li>Enable more flexible responses to emerging constraints</li>
<li>Create environments conducive to innovation and continuous improvement</li>
</ul>
<p>Evidence from projects using these models demonstrates significant improvements. The A14 Cambridge to Huntingdon improvement scheme, delivered through a collaborative contracting approach, finished ahead of schedule despite its complexity. Similar successes with the M4 Smart Motorway and A19 Testo&#39;s Junction improvement project further demonstrate the potential of collaborative approaches to overcome traditional bottlenecks.</p>
<h3 id="digital-transformation-strategies">Digital Transformation Strategies</h3>
<p>Digital transformation offers powerful tools to address various bottlenecks simultaneously. However, realising these benefits requires strategic implementation rather than piecemeal technology adoption.</p>
<p>Key elements of effective digital transformation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enterprise-wide data strategies ensuring consistent information structures</li>
<li>Common data environments enabling seamless information sharing</li>
<li>Reality capture technologies reducing reliance on manual measurements</li>
<li>Predictive analytics supporting proactive constraint management</li>
<li>Automation of repetitive administrative tasks freeing human resources for value-adding activities</li>
</ul>
<p>The most successful implementations integrate technologies into cohesive ecosystems rather than deploying isolated point solutions. This integrated approach addresses multiple bottlenecks simultaneously, creating synergistic efficiency improvements that exceed the sum of individual interventions.</p>
<h3 id="policy-and-regulatory-reform">Policy and Regulatory Reform</h3>
<p>Many road construction bottlenecks stem from policy and regulatory frameworks that prioritise risk avoidance over efficiency. Addressing these systemic constraints requires reform at multiple levels.</p>
<p>Promising reform directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Streamlined approval processes with clear decision timelines</li>
<li>Performance-based specifications enabling innovation while ensuring outcomes</li>
<li>Standardised contract forms reducing administrative overhead</li>
<li>Balanced risk allocation aligned with control capabilities</li>
<li>Consistent funding mechanisms supporting long-term planning</li>
</ul>
<p>The Project Speed initiative launched by the UK government represents a step toward addressing these systemic bottlenecks, but more fundamental reforms may be necessary to achieve substantial improvements. International examples like Germany&#39;s planning acceleration legislation demonstrate the potential impact of comprehensive regulatory reform.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Road construction bottlenecks represent complex, interconnected challenges that require systemic solutions. From planning and approval delays to material shortages, from traffic management constraints to digital fragmentation, these bottlenecks collectively undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure delivery.</p>
<p>Addressing these constraints requires multifaceted approaches combining technological innovation, process improvement, cultural change, and policy reform. No single intervention can resolve all bottlenecks; rather, integrated strategies targeting multiple constraints simultaneously offer the greatest potential for transformative improvement.</p>
<p>The future of road construction lies not in perpetuating existing practices but in fundamentally reimagining how infrastructure is planned, designed, and delivered. By identifying and systematically addressing the bottlenecks that constrain current practices, the industry can achieve the step-change improvement necessary to meet growing infrastructure needs within increasingly constrained economic and environmental parameters.</p>
<p>The challenges are substantial, but the potential rewards—more efficient delivery, reduced disruption, improved quality, lower costs, and enhanced sustainability—justify the effort required. By confronting bottlenecks directly rather than accepting them as inevitable, the road construction industry can build a more efficient and effective future for infrastructure delivery.</p>
